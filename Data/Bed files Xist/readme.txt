Folders:

-- deltaSHAPE_confirmed
contains files named [protein]_dS_motifs.bed listing the deltaSHAPE-confirmed binding sites (the filled circles from Fig. 4).

-- CLIPdb_transcript_coords
contains all CLIPdb binding sites for each protein (all circles from Fig. 4).

-- CLIPdb_genomic_coords
contains the same data as transcript_coords except data are annotated in mm10 genomic coordinates
