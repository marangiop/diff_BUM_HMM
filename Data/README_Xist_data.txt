Since the probing chemistry used to obtain the mice Xist lncRNA dataset was RT-mutate, we tallied the reads counts
and substitution/deletion counts from the raw reads. The raw sequencing data was obtained from the sequence read archive, accession
no. SRP074108. I downloaded only the replicates for IC (in vivo) and EV (ex vivo), when probed by 1M7 or in control conditions (DMSO).
