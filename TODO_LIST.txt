1) We need Jupyter notebooks that contain the bash code used for running dStruct and diffBUM-HMM for each Figure.
The goal is that people can download the repository and simply run the code from within the folder.

2) We need to check what figures that are no longer used can be removed.

3) We need to weed through the "Old" folder and decide what to do with the data in it.

4) @Toby, could you made a notebook of the code that you used to download and analyse the rRNA data? I believe this was done using the pyCRAC_PE pipeline?
