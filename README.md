# diffBUM_HMM
Bayesian modelling approach for detecting RNA flexibility changes in high-throughput structure probing data

## Background 
DiffBUM-HMM (differential BUM-HMM) is a natural extension of the beta-uniform mixture hidden Markov model developed previously [Selega2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27819660/). TO BE COMPLETED
